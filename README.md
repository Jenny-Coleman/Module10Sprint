## Getting Started

By accessing the project using the link https://github.com/Jenny-Coleman/Module9Week4Sprint you will be able to see and access all the files. To download and run the files on 
your machine you need to "Clone or download", you will find this a button that will allow you to do this on the right (it is a green button with the words "Clone or download" 
on it). To run it, it is recommended that you clone to GitHub Desktop and run it on NetBeans but you can download a zip file and run it on any Java IDE. To run it on NetBeans 
you need to create a new project and move the file into the projects "src" folder. You will then need to sign-in using a vaild username and password. Valid logins are logins that are present and correct in the selected table, it is key sensitive.
